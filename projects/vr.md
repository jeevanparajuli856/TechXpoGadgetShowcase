## ⭐ What Is Virtual Reality (VR)?
Virtual Reality allows you to **step inside a digital world** instead of just looking at a screen.  
Put on the headset, and suddenly you’re standing in a virtual lab, a new city, a game world — anywhere.

It’s one of the most immersive technologies ever created.

## ⭐ How VR Actually Works
VR combines:
- **Head tracking** – the scene moves when you move  
- **Hand controllers** – to grab, point, and interact  
- **3D visuals** – one screen per eye for depth  
- **Spatial audio** – sound coming from correct directions  

Together, these tricks convince your brain that the virtual world is *real*.
