## ⭐ What Is a Network Switch?
A network switch acts like a **traffic director** for devices in a building.  
It connects computers, printers, and servers — making sure every piece of data reaches the right place quickly and safely.

If Wi-Fi is the “air,” the switch is the **heart of the wired network**.

## ⭐ Why Switches Matter
- Keep data organized  
- Provide fast, stable connections  
- Improve security  
- Allow large networks to run smoothly

## ⭐ Enterprise vs Consumer Switches  
### 🏠 **Home Switch**
- Simple  
- Handles a few devices  
- Limited features  

### 🏢 **Enterprise Switch**
- Supports many devices  
- Strong security  
- VLANs & traffic control  
- Designed to run 24/7  

The Cisco Catalyst 2950s is an **enterprise-grade switch** used in universities and businesses.

## ⭐ How It Works (Simple Example)
Imagine a busy hallway.  
Each student (device) wants to deliver a message to a classroom.

The switch is the **helper** who:
- Knows every classroom  
- Delivers messages without mixing them up  
- Prevents traffic jams

## ⭐ Why Students Should Care
Every online activity — from Canvas to Netflix — depends on switches.  
Understanding them shows how real-world networks stay connected.
